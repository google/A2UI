## Project Partners

A2UI is developed in collaboration with several organizations:

### AG UI / CopilotKit

[AG UI](https://ag-ui.com/) and [CopilotKit](https://www.copilotkit.ai/) provide day-zero compatibility with A2UI, enabling developers to build rich, state-synced applications that render dynamic UIs from agents.

### Google Opal

[Opal](http://opal.google) lets users build, edit, and share AI mini-apps using natural language. The Opal team has been a core contributor to A2UI's development.

### Flutter / GenUI SDK

The [Flutter GenUI SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui) uses A2UI as the UI declaration format for generating dynamic, personalized UIs in Flutter applications.

### Gemini Enterprise

A2UI is being integrated into Gemini Enterprise to enable custom agents to render rich, interactive UIs within enterprise applications.
