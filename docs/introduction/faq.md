# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is the difference between v0.8 and v0.9?
**v0.8** is the previous stable version of the A2UI specification. It is preserved for reference for existing implementations.
**v0.9** is the current version, introducing significant improvements such as the "Prompt-First" design, better streaming support, and decoupled architecture. We recommend all new projects start with v0.9.

### Can I mix versions?
No, A2UI versions are distinct. An agent speaking v0.9 should communicate with a client supporting v0.9. The protocol version is negotiated or specified in the message envelope.

### Where can I find the v0.8 documentation?
You can access the [v0.8 documentation](../v0.8/quickstart.md) via the navigation menu under "Specifications > v0.8" or by browsing the v0.8 section in the sidebar.
