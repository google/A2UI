    "# Personalized Learning Demo - Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "A full-stack A2UI sample demonstrating personalized educational content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contributed by Google Public Sector's Rapid Innovation Team.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maria Thompson** is a pre-med student at Cymbal University preparing for the MCAT. She excels in biology (92%) but struggles with chemistry concepts—particularly the common misconception that \"energy is stored in ATP bonds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How we find that information about a student's misconceptions across multiple courses is actually part of a broader project at Google Public Sector. But for now, we're just running with information we have related to one of those misconceptions, represented by the text files in the `learner_context/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo includes a [learner profile visualization](http://localhost:5174/maria-context.html) showing Maria's:\n",
    "- Academic background and current proficiency levels\n",
    "- Identified misconceptions to address\n",
    "- Learning preferences (visual-kinesthetic, sports/gym analogies)\n",
    "\n",
    "This profile represents the kind of data a real personalization pipeline would generate from learning management systems, assessment results, and curriculum graphs. Once we have that data, how do we best use it to impact a student's learning trajectory?\n",
    "\n",
    "We think the A2UI framework enables an excellent learning experience, and this demo intends to show how.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Content Is Generated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Source:** [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) — free, peer-reviewed textbooks covering 167 chapters across biology, chemistry, physics, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation Pipeline:**\n",
    "- User requests a topic (e.g., \"Help me understand ATP\")\n",
    "- The agent uses an LLM to match the topic to the most relevant OpenStax chapter\n",
    "- Content is fetched and transformed into A2UI components (flashcards, quizzes)\n",
    "- The frontend renders whatever A2UI JSON the agent returns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learn More:**\n",
    "- [How A2UI Works](http://localhost:5174/a2ui-primer.html) — interactive explanation in the demo\n",
    "- [A2UI Specification](../../docs/) — canonical documentation in this repo\n",

    "| Concept | What This Demo Shows |\n",
    "|---------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Remote Agent Deployment** | Deploy an AI agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine that runs independently from your UI |\n",
    "| **A2A Protocol** | Use the Agent-to-Agent protocol to communicate between your frontend and the remote agent |\n",
    "| **Custom UI Components** | Extend A2UI with custom components (Flashcard, QuizCard) beyond the standard library |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Content Generation** | Generate personalized A2UI JSON on-the-fly based on user requests |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Context from GCS** | Load learner profiles from Cloud Storage — swap context without redeploying |\n",
    "| **Intelligent Content Matching** | Use LLMs to match user topics to relevant textbook content (167 OpenStax chapters) |\n",

    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In production agentic systems:\n",
    "- **Agents run remotely** — they scale independently, can be updated without redeploying the UI, and may be operated by third parties\n",
    "- **UI is decoupled** — the frontend renders whatever A2UI JSON the agent sends, without knowing the agent's implementation\n",
    "- **A2A enables interoperability** — any A2A-compatible agent can power your UI, regardless of how it's built\n",
    "- **Context is dynamic** — learner profiles are loaded from GCS at runtime, enabling personalization without redeployment\n",

    "| **Step 2: Configuration** | Sets your GCP project ID |\n",
    "| **Step 3: GCP Authentication** | Authenticates with Google Cloud, enables APIs, and uploads learner context to GCS |\n",
    "| **Step 4: Deploy Agent** | Deploys the AI agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine |\n",
    "| **Step 5: Configure & Run** | Creates config files and launches the demo |\n",
    "| **Step 6 (Optional)** | Generate audio/video content with NotebookLM |\n",
    "| **Step 7: Production Deployment** | Deploy to Cloud Run + Firebase Hosting for a shareable URL |\n",
