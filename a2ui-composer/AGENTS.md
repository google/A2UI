# Repository Guidelines

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `pnpm install` once, then `pnpm dev` for the web server (Next.js watches on port 3000). Build artifacts with `pnpm build`;

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
TypeScript and modern React are mandatory; prefer function components and colocate UI logic in `app/components`. Follow Prettier's defaults (two-space indentation, single quotes) by running `pnpm format` before commits. Component files use PascalCase (e.g., `AgentPanel.tsx`); hooks and utilities use camelCase in `*.ts`. The shared ESLint preset (`packages/eslint-config`) enforces `turbo/no-undeclared-env-vars`, so surface new env variables via typed helpers.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no bundled unit-test runner yet, so treat linting and type-checking as minimum CI gates. Keep test fixtures (JSON, mock responses) alongside the code they exercise to match existing samples.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Existing history uses short imperative subjects ("Add themed a2ui surface"); continue that pattern and reference issues in the footer as needed. Each PR should state scope, testing evidence, and any UI screenshots or terminal output that prove the agent path. Link design docs and flag follow-ups; ensure CI (`pnpm build`) is green before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration
Never commit `.env` files or API keys; use `.env.local` for web and `.env` inside sample agents. Document any new secrets in `README.md`
