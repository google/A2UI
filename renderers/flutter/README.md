# Flutter Gen UI SDK

The [Flutter Gen UI SDK](https://github.com/flutter/genui) is the official Flutter renderer for A2UI. This separate but closely related project provides a comprehensive Flutter library to integrate generative UI into applications.

Beyond its role as an A2UI renderer, the Flutter Gen UI SDK offers additional functionalities, including implementations for client-side agents, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences powered by Large Language Models.

Key packages from the Flutter Gen UI SDK include:

*   [`genui`](https://pub.dev/packages/genui): The core framework for employing Generative UI in Flutter applications.
*   [`genui_a2ui`](https://pub.dev/packages/genui_a2ui): This package specifically allows the Flutter Gen UI SDK to act as a renderer for UIs generated by an A2UI backend agent, integrating with the A2UI protocol.
