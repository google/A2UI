# Flutter Gen UI SDK

The [Flutter Gen UI SDK](https://github.com/flutter/genui) is the official Flutter renderer for A2UI. This separate but closely related project provides a comprehensive Flutter library to integrate generative UI into applications.

Beyond its role as an A2UI renderer, the Flutter Gen UI SDK offers additional functionalities, including implementations for client-side agents, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences powered by Large Language Models.
